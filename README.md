## Brief description:

I have used ES6 in the app, and services to retrieve the data from the API. There is a parent component "App" with the header and a child component "Gnomes" with the list of cards that contain the info of each gnome living in the city of Brastlewark. The list can be filtered by searching citizen names in the search bar.
The app is responsive, using Mobile first design.

## Things to improve:

Add pagination to increase the performance. There are 1337 objects being retrieved from the API.
Add tests. I know how to pass them. I have still to dedicate some time to learn how to program unitary tests.
